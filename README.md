# icc3.reliability
This R function was initially written by Mark James Adams. It was
later modified by Alexander Weiss. Briefly, the function
icc3.reliability computes two intraclass correlations (ICCs) for use
in assessing interrater reliability. Both ICCs, and how they are
computed, are described by Shrout and Fleiss (1979). The first,
ICC(3,1) is the reliability of individual ratings when raters are
fixed. The second, ICC(3,k) is the reliability of scores based on the
mean of k raters.
